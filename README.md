# NBA_Weight_Height_Distribution
A small study to check how the Weight and Height standards have changed over the years. 


More specifically the goal was to see how weights and heights have changed throughout the last 20 years, to understand how teams change their perspective as the game evolves. 

The main reason for this study has been the constant evolution of the Center position (From the heavy and slow Roy Hibberts of this world to the more agile and light Jarret Allens) and the extinction of really small explosive guards (Isaiah Thomas might be the last of them).
